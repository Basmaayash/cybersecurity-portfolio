# Parking Lot USB Exercise

## Contents
The USB drive has both personal and work files. Some documents contain Jorgeâ€™s personal photos and information, while others include work data such as new hire letters and employee schedules. These files may contain personal information (PII) that should not be shared publicly.

## Attacker Mindset
An attacker could use the employee schedules or personal photos to learn more about Jorge and his coworkers. They might send fake emails pretending to be a colleague or relative to trick him. This information could also help them plan a social engineering attack against the hospital.

## Risk Analysis
To reduce this type of risk, employees should be trained not to plug unknown USB drives into work computers. Antivirus scans and USB device control policies should be used to detect or block threats. Disabling AutoPlay can prevent malware from running automatically. Managers should also create clear policies and reminders about handling unknown devices.
