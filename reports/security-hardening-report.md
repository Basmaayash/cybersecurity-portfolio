# üîê Security Hardening Report  
**Analyst:** Basma  
**Organization:** Social Media Company  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Incident:** Major Data Breach ‚Äì Customer Information Leak  

## üß© Part 1: Selected Hardening Tools and Techniques

Following the analysis of the incident, three key security hardening techniques were selected to improve the organization‚Äôs network defense and prevent future breaches:

1. **Port Filtering**  
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
3. **Encryption Using the Latest Standards**

These methods address specific vulnerabilities observed during the assessment, such as:
- Absence of firewall rules
- Lack of user authentication layers
- Use of weak or shared passwords
- Insufficient protection of sensitive customer data

### üîß How to Implement These Methods:

- **Port Filtering**: Configure firewall rules to allow only necessary ports, blocking all others. This minimizes the attack surface and prevents unauthorized access attempts.  
- **MFA**: Implement multi-factor authentication for all employees, especially those accessing critical systems, by requiring a second verification step such as a phone code or biometric.  
- **Encryption**: Encrypt all sensitive data in storage and in transit using industry standards like AES-256. Apply least privilege access to limit who can access encrypted data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Rationale for the Recommendations

### 1. **Port Filtering**
Port filtering is an effective way to control inbound and outbound network traffic. By blocking unnecessary ports, organizations can prevent malicious actors from exploiting unused or vulnerable services. It significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and mitigates scanning or exploitation attempts.  
**Recommended frequency:** Monthly review or after any major infrastructure change.

### 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
MFA adds a powerful layer of security beyond traditional passwords. Even if a password is compromised, attackers would still need a second authentication method, such as a verification code or fingerprint. This greatly reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks and discourages password sharing among employees.  
**Recommended frequency:** Continuous enforcement, with periodic audits of coverage and compliance.

### 3. **Encryption Using the Latest Standards**
Encrypting sensitive data ensures that even if the system is breached, the information remains protected and unreadable without proper decryption keys. Using strong encryption algorithms such as AES-256 safeguards customer data and maintains regulatory compliance.  
**Recommended frequency:** Review encryption protocols every 3‚Äì6 months, or after major threat disclosures.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Implementing port filtering, MFA, and robust encryption collectively enhances the organization‚Äôs security posture. These strategies will help mitigate risks of unauthorized access, data theft, and further incidents. Combined, they reflect industry best practices and demonstrate a proactive approach to protecting customer data and maintaining system integrity.
