# SQL Filters Activity

Welcome to my Cybersecurity portfolio! This activity demonstrates how I leverage SQL filters (AND, OR, NOT) to extract actionable insights from employee and login data. By applying these techniques, I can efficiently identify security risks, manage system updates, and ensure that the organization's IT environment remains protected.

In this project, I worked with multiple tables, including `employees` and `log_in_attempts`, to:  
- Retrieve employees in specific departments for targeted updates.  
- Exclude certain groups to focus on critical tasks.  
- Analyze login attempts to detect potential security issues.

This portfolio piece highlights not only my technical skills with SQL, but also my attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and readiness to handle real-world cybersecurity challenges. Screenshots and examples included in the PDF demonstrate my step-by-step approach, making it easy for HR or hiring managers to understand both the process and the results.
